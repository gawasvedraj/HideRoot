## Modules

### All Root Solutions

- [Zygisk Next](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskNext/releases) (A modern Zygisk Implementation)

  - Don't forget to disable inbuilt Zygisk from Magisk Settings.

  - Use CI for better compatibility and bug fixes.

- [Tricky Store](https://github.com/5ec1cff/TrickyStore/releases) (A trick of keystore)

  - [5ec1cff's Guide](https://5ec1cff.github.io/TrickyStore/)

  - You can find the package name of Apps in App Info.

- Play Integrity

    _You don't need to use these modules if you have valid keybox with KSU/APatch on Stock ROM._

    - [Play Integrity Fix](https://github.com/chiteroman/PlayIntegrityFix/releases)

      - Just works module for noobies.

    - [Play Integrity Fork](https://github.com/osm0sis/PlayIntegrityFork/releases)

      - For nerds with many scripts inbuilt.


- [Sensitive Props](https://www.pling.com/p/2129780/)

  - Use only if you're on a Custom ROM.

### Magisk / KernelSU

- [Shamiko](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed.github.io/releases)

  - Disable "Enforce Denylist" from Magisk Settings.

### KernelSU

- [susfs4ksu](https://github.com/sidex15/susfs4ksu-module/releases/latest)

  - Use only if you've integrated SusFS in Kernel.

### APatch

- [Cherish Peekaboo](https://t.me/app_process64)

  - [KPM Usage Guide](https://apatch.dev/kpm-usage-guide.html)

### LSPosed Modules

- [HideMyApplist](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/Hide-My-Applist/releases/latest)

  - Create a blacklist template then add apps you want to hide (Magisk, LSPosed Modules, MT Manager and other suspicious apps.)

  - Apply the template to the target app (Bank App, Games etc...)

  - Alternatively you can use whitelist but don't forget to add atleast one non supicious app because some apps detect it.
